Step 4: Advanced Validation Tool
=================================
Demonstrates conditional business logic within tools.
Shows how to implement approval thresholds and multi-tier validation.

Key Concepts:
    - Business Rules: Encoding company policies in code
    - Conditional Logic: Different outcomes based on input values
    - Approval Workflows: Routing invoices based on amount thresholds
    - Risk Management: Flagging high-value transactions for review

What This Does:
    - Validates invoices against amount thresholds
    - Auto-approves low-value invoices
    - Flags high-value invoices for manual approval

Enhancement Suggestions:
    1. Implement multi-tier approval levels (manager, director, CFO)
    2. Add department-specific budget validation
    3. Integrate with approval workflow systems
    4. Add email/Slack notifications to approvers
    5. Implement time-based auto-approval for trusted vendors
    6. Add fraud detection scoring
    7. Cross-reference with purchase orders
    8. Implement seasonal or project-based budget rules
    9. Add vendor risk scoring
    10. Create audit trail for all validation decisions

    Validate invoice and determine approval status based on business rules.
    
    Args:
        amount: Invoice amount (numeric value)
        currency: Currency code (USD, EUR, etc.)
        
    Returns:
        Approval status: "APPROVED" or "REQUIRES_APPROVAL"
        
    Current Rules:
        - Amounts <= $10,000: Auto-approved
        - Amounts > $10,000: Requires manual approval
        
    Enhancement Ideas:
        - Add multi-tier thresholds ($10K, $50K, $100K, etc.)
        - Implement currency-specific thresholds
        - Add vendor-based rules (trusted vendors get higher limits)
        - Check against available budget
        - Add time-of-day or day-of-week rules
        - Implement ML-based fraud detection
        - Add industry-specific validation
        - Support custom approval chains by department
        - Add duplicate invoice checking
        - Implement velocity checks (too many invoices in short time)
